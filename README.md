# SoliHut

## It's a ... whoa?
An autumn morning, as the first sunlight lining over mounts and touching your window lattice, you leaving your cottage and stepping into a forest far away from your village. It's such a breath-taking virgin that you almost lose yourself there. Following swift larks, you find a ivy covered hut, standing in its solitude.

## Which morning to go?
We may go setting off at mid June.  
or may not.

## Knock on my door.
